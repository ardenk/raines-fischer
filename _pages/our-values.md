<h1>Our Values</h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>It’s about more than just the numbers. It’s about you.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Once you become a client of Raines &amp; Fischer, you’ll quickly discover that we put one important principle before all others: our clients come first. That means that, regardless of your organization’s size, your industry, or the services you require, we make it our business to understand your specific goals and accounting needs, and to meet them with a high level of personalized service at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>The expertise of a Big-Four firm.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Established in 1984, Raines &amp; Fischer LLP is a full-service Certified Public Accounting firm based in New York City, whose primary focus is to service closely held entrepreneurial-run businesses, start-up hedge funds, and high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of our partners are highly skilled CPAs and many of our staff hold advanced degrees in the areas of law, taxation, and finance, giving you the same level and breadth of expertise usually found only at Big-Four firms. We are committed to exceeding industry standards and to providing continuing professional development for all of our staff.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain our standing within the profession, we participate in the AICPA Peer Review Program and have developed formal quality control practices and procedures that meet the most stringent professional standards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>The individualized attention and direct partner involvement of a consultancy.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Taking advantage of our advanced skills and talent doesn’t mean sacrificing personalized service. In fact, it’s our focus on service that has afforded the long-term relationships we enjoy with our clients. Right from the start, you will be assigned a dedicated team of professionals upon whom you can rely for any need, however great or small. From resolving a simple tax matter to structuring a complex new deal, the appropriate level of attention and expertise you require – from Associate to Partner – is just an email or phone call away.</p>
