<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>Raines &amp; Fischer has extensive experience fulfilling the unique tax and accounting needs of Real Estate Developers.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a real estate developer, you know how important it is to have a trusted CPA resource by your side to navigate all the accounting and tax challenges that inevitably arise between the moment you find a property and the last phase of development. We can advise you on setting up your business, including entity selection and review of formation documents – and that is just the beginning. You can also lean on us to assist in preparing construction and operating budgets, securing various tax credits, and understanding complex tax issues such as cost-segregation, bonus depreciation, and 1031 exchanges.</p>
<p><b><strong>Receive highly personalized service and expert advisement all under one roof – at a reasonable cost.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Raines &amp; Fischer has long considered real estate one of its core industries. We count real estate developers as some of our largest clients, and have decades of experience in preparing tax returns, auditing financial statements, and providing general advisement to our real estate developer clients. Our managing partner, Alan P. Raines, Esq., is also a practicing attorney, who counts real estate as one of his major practice areas and can represent developers when they are looking to purchase or sell property. At our firm, you get experienced and full service advisement every step of the way.</p>
