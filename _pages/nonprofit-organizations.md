<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>Raines &amp; Fischer understands the unique needs of nonprofit organizations.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your nonprofit organization has distinct needs compared to most other kinds of businesses. While nonprofits are not usually concerned with paying taxes, there are complexities in the industry when it comes to tax and regulatory compliance that could undermine your organization if you are not given the proper guidance. Stiff penalties often accompany missteps in tax and regulatory filings, so it is important to have an experienced CPA firm to advise you and to audit or review your financial statements, when the need arises.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>We have been helping nonprofits meet their regulatory obligations and achieve their missions for more than 30 years.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over this period we have developed a unique perspective on nonprofits, as we have seen this industry from every angle. We have partners who have served on nonprofit organization boards, have assisted organizations in recruiting and training their senior accounting executives, and have offered ongoing guidance in the complex tax and regulatory landmines that challenge the industry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With our depth of experience in the industry, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all the tax and accounting services your nonprofit needs.</p>
