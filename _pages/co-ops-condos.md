<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>Raines &amp; Fischer has more than 30 years of experience serving co-ops and condos in the New York area.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Co-op and condo owners usually require that the buildings they own be audited or reviewed by an independent accountant. Although general, ongoing back-office services are usually managed by a professional real estate management firm, there is still the need for financial statement preparation as well as professional advisement on numerous tax functions, including the preparation of year-end tax returns, issuance of 1099s, and issuance of shareholder tax information and 1098s. The tax code is always changing and condos and co-ops need expert tax advice on such issues as bonus depreciation and repairs and maintenance deductibility.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>Enjoy comprehensive, personalized service, and a full understanding of the needs of your building.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Raines &amp; Fischer has served co-op and condo owners in all functions – as independent auditors, tax preparers, and property managers. In the process, we have developed a unique understanding of what services these buildings need from the audit side, the tax side, and the property management side. Although we cannot service all functions for the same client (due to independence requirements for auditors), our varied experience allows us to have a deeper perspective on your building’s needs.</p>
