[/pillar_icon_box][pillar_icon_box icon="icon-Apple" layout="boxed-icon" title="Nonprofit Organizations"]Your nonprofit organization has distinct needs compared to most other kinds of businesses. While nonprofits are not usually concerned with paying taxes, there are complexities in the industry when it comes to tax and regulatory compliance that could undermine your organization if you are not given the proper guidance. Stiff penalties often accompany missteps in tax and regulatory filings, so it is important to have an experienced CPA firm to advise you and to audit or review your financial statements, when the need arises.

We have partners who have served on nonprofit organization boards, have assisted organizations in recruiting and training their senior accounting executives, and have offered ongoing guidance in the complex tax and regulatory landmines that challenge the industry.[/pillar_icon_box][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][pillar_icon_box icon="icon-Truck" layout="boxed-icon" title="Wholesale Distributors"]Raines &amp; Fischer has worked with wholesale distributors for many years, and they have been among our largest clients.
