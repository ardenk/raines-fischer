<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Raines &amp; Fischer can take care of your tax and accounting needs, so you can take care of your patients.</strong></p>
As a doctor, dentist, or other medical professional, your time is best spent attending to your patients, not worrying about tax deadlines and cash flow. To that end, we take a proactive approach to assisting and advising you on the tax and business issues that are key to keeping your practice running smoothly, including entity selection, budgeting, year-end tax planning, tax return filing, and a number of other accounting and tax needs that arise throughout the year.

In addition, if you do not have your own bookkeeper or accounting staff, we can serve as – or supplement – your in-house accounting department to set up and maintain your books and financial records. We can also take on an advisory role and assist you with business planning and management, cash flow analysis, and periodic P&amp;L reviews, and much more.

<strong>We have been helping practices like yours operate efficiently and maximize their profitability for more than 30 years.</strong>

Raines &amp; Fischer has worked with medical and dental professionals since the inception of the firm. With our depth of experience in your profession, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all your tax and accounting services.
