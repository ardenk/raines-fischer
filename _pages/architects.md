<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>For architects, Raines &amp; Fischer knows the last thing you want to be doing is paperwork.
</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an architect, your time is best spent meeting with clients and bringing your projects to fruition, not worrying about bookkeeping and taxes. To that end, we take a proactive approach to assisting and advising you on the tax and business issues that are particularly important to architecture firms, including cash flow management, time tracking and billing, year-end tax planning, 1099 issuance, budgeting, and sales tax and income tax compliance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we can represent you during sales tax, IRS, and workers' compensation audits should the need ever arise, and for smaller firms that do not have a bookkeeper or accounting staff, we can serve as – or supplement – your in-house accounting department.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>We've been helping architects operate efficiently and increase their profitability for more than 30 years.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Raines &amp; Fischer has worked with architects for many years. With our “on-the-ground” experience in the industry, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all your tax and accounting services.</p>
