<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>For GCs and Subs, Raines &amp; Fischer knows the last thing you want to be doing is paperwork.<br />
</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a contractor, your time is best spent at the job site, not worrying about bookkeeping and taxes. To that end, we take a proactive approach to assisting and advising you on the tax and business issues that are particularly important to building contractors and the trades, including cash flow management, purchasing and inventory tracking, time tracking and billing, year-end tax planning, and 1099 form issuance. In addition, for smaller firms that do not have a bookkeeper or accounting staff, we can serve as – or supplement – your in-house accounting department.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we can evaluate accounting methods for long-term contracts, advise you on sales tax and payroll regulations, and represent you during sales tax, IRS, and workers' compensation audits, should the need ever arise.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>We've been helping contractors succeed and increase their profitability for more than 30 years.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With our "on-the-ground" experience in the industry, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all your tax and accounting services.</p>
