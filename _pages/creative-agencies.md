<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>For business owners in the creative field, Raines &amp; Fischer knows that paperwork is last thing you want to think about.
</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Creative firms hold a special place at Raines &amp; Fischer. We understand that, as a creative person, you may rely on your CPA more than other entrepreneurs who have a more formal business background. To that end, we take a proactive approach to assisting and advising you on the tax and business issues that are particularly relevant to agencies, including employee vs. freelancer status, time tracking and billing, cash vs. accrual accounting, budgeting, year-end tax planning, and 1099 form issuance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We can serve as tax advisors in agency mergers, and respresent you in sales tax, IRS, and workers' compensation audits, should the need ever arise. And for smaller firms that do not have their own accounting staff, we can serve as – or supplement – your in-house accounting department.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>We've been helping creative agencies operate efficiently and increase their profitablility for more than 30 years.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Raines &amp; Fischer has been working with creative agencies from well before the Internet boom right up through today. With our “on-the-ground” experience in the industry, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all your tax and accounting services.</p>
