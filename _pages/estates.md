Wholesale distribution companies have specialized accounting needs that demand experienced, professional advice. To that end, we take a proactive approach to assisting and advising you on the tax and business issues that are key to keeping your business running smoothly, including sales tax compliance, dealing with auditors from various compliance agencies, including the IRS and state taxing authorities, and determining the proper way to value inventory for your financial reporting.

In addition, if you do not have your own bookkeeper or accounting staff, we can serve as – or supplement – your in-house accounting department to set up and maintain your books and financial records. We can also take on an advisory role and assist you with business planning and management, cash flow analysis, periodic P&amp;L reviews, and merger/buyout arrangements.

<strong>We have been helping wholesale distribution companies operate efficiently and maximize their profitability for more than 30 years.</strong>

Raines &amp; Fischer has worked with wholesale distributors for many years, and they have been among our largest clients. With our depth of experience in the industry, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all your tax and accounting services.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/4"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
