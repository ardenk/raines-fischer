<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>When choosing a firm to handle your estate planning, experience and service matter.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trust and estate planning has always been an important function, and it has become increasingly complex and challenging in recent years as estate tax laws have been in constant flux. When looking for a firm to handle your needs, it’s crucial to choose experienced and skilled representation in planning for various trust and estate issues, as missteps can lead to large, unexpected tax bills. You need a firm with both CPA and legal experience that can plan for the unexpected, is up to date on the constant law changes, and is able to take the lead when it comes to tax compliance. You need a firm that can help you develop an estate plan, is familiar with the many trust instruments available, and is prepared and experienced enough to tackle all the complex issues that will arise.</p>
