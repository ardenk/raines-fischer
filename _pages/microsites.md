<p class="lead">When we conceived Pillar we had niche design in our hearts. The ultimate goal for Pillar was to create a design toolkit of consistent, gorgeous elements &amp; typography that could be subtly re-tooled for almost any niche.</p>
Our microsites are a pure embrace of this idea, we're taking Pillar and making small, niche based demos that you can easily import and get working with, without having to work with the usual huge demo that themes provide.
<ul>
 	<li>Each microsite comes with its own .xml for you to import only what you need.</li>
 	<li>Your purchase of Pillar comes with <strong>EVERY</strong> microsite, and the main Pillar theme.</li>
 	<li>Speed up your workflow by working with demo content created just for your niche.</li>
 	<li>Tell us if you have an idea for a niche we should have a microsite for!</li>
</ul>
