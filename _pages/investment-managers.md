Investment managers have many complex challenges facing them. Whether it is annual changes to the tax code for investments, or new regulatory requirements announced by the SEC, new laws and regulations are coming out at every turn. Raines &amp; Fischer can serve as a valuable resource for professional advice and guidance to navigate these uncertain waters.

For hedge fund managers, we will help guide you through these changes, allowing you to concentrate on your portfolios, rather than on the IRS or SEC. For start-up investment managers, we can help you face your own distinct set of challenges by providing guidance on entity structure, SEC, or other governmental agency registration, helping you decide what other service providers are needed, determining whether to launch as a hedge fund or manage separate accounts, and the many other questions facing new investment managers.

<strong>Enjoy the benefits of our vast experience and highly personalized service at a reasonable cost.</strong>

Raines &amp; Fischer has more than 20 years of experience in the industry, serving all sorts of investment managers from large to small, from hedge fund managers to registered investment advisors. Most of our investment manager clients have been with us since they started their businesses and have trusted Raines &amp; Fischer as a valuable resource, every step of the way. Other firms may tout their experience as a whole but then assign younger staff with less experience to your account. We give our investment manager clients partner-level attention, and our flexible fee structure is designed specifically to offer a cost-effective solution for managers of start-up or smaller/mid-size funds.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/4"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
