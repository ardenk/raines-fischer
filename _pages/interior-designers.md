<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>For interior designers, Raines &amp; Fischer knows the last thing you want to be doing is paperwork.<br />
</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an interior designer, your time is best spent meeting with clients and realizing your projects, not worrying about bookkeeping and taxes. To that end, we take a proactive approach to assisting and advising you on the tax and business issues that are particularly important to designers, including sales tax compliance, employee vs. freelancer status, cash vs. accrual accounting, budgeting, year-end tax planning, 1099 form issuance, and other accounting or tax needs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we can represent you during sales tax, IRS, and workers' compensation audits, should the need ever arise, and if you don't have a bookkeeper or accounting staff, we can serve as – or supplement – your in-house accounting department.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>We've been helping interior designers operate efficiently and increase their profitability for more than 30 years.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With our “on-the-ground” experience in the industry, reasonable fees, high level of personalized service, and partner-level involvement, Raines &amp; Fischer is the perfect choice to provide all your tax and accounting services.</p>
